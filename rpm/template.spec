%description
The containers included here are intended to extend the stl containers. In all
cases, these implementations are designed to implement c++ conveniences and
safety where speed is not sacrificed. Also includes techniques for memory
debugging of common problems such as buffer overruns.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
