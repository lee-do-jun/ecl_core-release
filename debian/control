Description: Interprocess mechanisms vary greatly across platforms - sysv, posix, win32, there are more than a few.
 This package provides an infrastructure to allow for developing cross platform c++ wrappers around the lower level c api's that handle these mechanisms. These make it not only easier to utilise such mechanisms, but allow it to be done consistently across platforms.
